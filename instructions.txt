Serves 4

Ingredients
800g boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
1 tbsp lemon juice
¼ cup plain unsweetened yoghurt
2 tsp paprika
2 tbsp neutral oil (I used grape seed)
50g butter
3 garlic cloves, crushed
1 tsp finely grated fresh ginger
2 tsp garam masala
1 tsp ground cardamom
1 tsp cinnamon
¼ tsp chilli powder (optional)
1 x 400g can tomato purée
1 tbsp brown sugar
½ cup chicken stock
½ cup cream
¼ cup plain unsweetened yoghurt
1 tsp dried fenugreek leaves (optional)
Fresh chopped parsley, to serve

Method
Mix the chicken with the lemon juice, yoghurt and paprika in a bowl, cover and marinate in the fridge for 20 minutes.

Heat the oil in frying pan over a high heat then sear the chicken pieces in batches until golden. Set aside.

Reduce the heat to medium, then add the butter, garlic, ginger, garam masala, cardamom, cinnamon and chilli. Cook, stirring constantly, for a couple of minutes until fragrant. Add the chicken pieces and juices back to the pan. Add the tomato purée, sugar and chicken stock. Simmer gently for about 15 minutes or until the sauce thickened, and the chicken is cooked through. Add the cream, yoghurt and fenugreek leaves if using, and simmer for another 5 minutes. Taste and season with salt, and sprinkle with the parsley.

Serve with basmati rice and naan bread.
