Method
Mix the chicken with the lemon juice, yoghurt and paprika in a bowl, cover and marinate in the fridge for 20 minutes.

Heat the oil in frying pan over a high heat then sear the chicken pieces in batches until golden. Set aside.

Reduce the heat to medium, then add the butter, garlic, ginger, garam masala, cardamom, cinnamon and chilli. Cook, stirring constantly, for a couple of minutes until fragrant. Add the chicken pieces and juices back to the pan. Add the tomato pur√©e, sugar and chicken stock. Simmer gently for about 15 minutes or until the sauce thickened, and the chicken is cooked through. Add the cream, yoghurt and fenugreek leaves if using, and simmer for another 5 minutes. Taste and season with salt, and sprinkle with the parsley.

Serve with basmati rice and naan bread.
